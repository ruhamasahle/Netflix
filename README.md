**Overview**
I coded, debugged and deployed this application for the popular streaming platform. It was challenging but rewarding to learn a relatively more complex project set up than the ones I had done before and I cannot help but marvel at the seamlessness of the integrations we have available to us as developers- particularly thinking of stripeâ€™s integration with firebase.

**Features and Flow**
This application is coded to allow a new user to sign up, it authenticates existing users and authorized users to access the netflix homepage. It also signs users out. 

The stripe integration to firebase was accomplished in the form of displaying what products are available for purchase (streaming plans) and providing a button to purchase the plan through a link that reroutes to a stripe checkout page.

**Difficulties**
One difficulty I faced piecing this project together is having difficulty seeing how all the granular parts come together. I had to take some time to understand what different components are at play that make the magic of netflix. Building out this clone, I began to understand how mesmerizing UX can be because until this opportunity necessitated me to look intently at what styling the original website uses, I did not nitpick the site. Instead, I simply enjoyed the unbounded immersion it cultivated. To that end, I must say, it dampens the immersive magic of Netflix a little bit :/

Additionally, some current issues I am working to resolve include the following:
  
  ðŸš© Stripe integration throws an error when a user attempts to purchase a plan- it does not reroute to the checkout page.

  ðŸš© Some of the endpoints from The Movie Database appear to not work as the API reference indicates. This will require getting more familiar with the API.

**Learning Point **
Reiterating my note above about the seamlessness of integrations, building out this project taught me how much agency learning how to code enables me; I can build a lot of things now! 

**Next Phase**
I would like to include a favorites page that allows a user to favorite any shows or films they come across and they can go to a page to view them all in one place.
